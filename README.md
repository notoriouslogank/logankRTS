Logank's Remote Tech Support is an attempt at a straightforward, easy-to-use interface for remote tech support for both Linux and Windows.  It aims to (eventually) be a one-click .exe file for the client allowing remote access for tech support; for now, it runs as a client.py module and as such requires a certain amount of interaction with the command line.
